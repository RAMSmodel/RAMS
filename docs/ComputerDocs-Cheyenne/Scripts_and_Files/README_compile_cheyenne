I could not get the large channel sim to run on Cheyenne until I compiled our versions of the MPI
HDF5 libraries and linked to those (as opposed to the Cheyenne built-in libraries).



In order to do compile our own HDF5 and MPI libriares, you need to clear paths to the
Cheyenne built-in libraries. Load/unload modules to get the following state:

  stephenh@cheyenne2:~/Rams/misc> module list

  Currently Loaded Modules:
    1) ncarenv/1.2   2) intel/17.0.1   3) ncarcompilers/0.4.1   4) slurm/17.02.4

Then save this state as your default:

  module save default

Then log out and log back in again. You need to do all of the above steps in order to clear out a
bunch of variables that point to the built-in libraries (NCAR_LDFLAGS_*, specifically).



Once the environment is set properly, untar the source code for the MPI libraries and run configure
(change --prefix path to where you want the libraries to be installed):

  ./configure --prefix=/glade/u/home/stephenh/Rams/misc/mpich2-1.4.1-install --disable-f77 -disable-fc --disable-cxx -enable-fast=O3 CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG --with-device=ch3:nemesis CC=icc FC=ifort F90=

Then compile the MPI libraries:

  make
  make install

Compile the HDF5 libraries (set --prefix to where you want the libraries installed, and set the path
to mpicc accordingly):

  ./configure --prefix=/glade/u/home/stephenh/Rams/misc/hdf5-1.8.9-install --disable-fortran --disable-fortran2003 --enable-parallel CC=/glade/u/home/stephenh/Rams/misc/mpich2-1.4.1-install/bin/mpicc
  make
  make install


Then use the source code saved in rams_20171109_rce_6.2.08 to compile RAMS. Set the paths for 
HDF5_ROOT and MPI_ROOT accordingly in the include.mk.cheyenne.mylibs file.
